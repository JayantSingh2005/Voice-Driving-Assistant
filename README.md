ðŸ§  Voice-based AI Driving Assistant â€” ML Engineer | Backend AI Developer
1) Fine-tuned XML-RoBERTa for multilingual NLU tasks: intent detection, emotion recognition, and NER; deployed with HuggingFace Transformers and PyTorch.

2) Built a FastAPI backend integrating speech-to-text (Whisper), text-to-speech (gTTS), Gemini 1.5 fallback, and real-time services (routing, traffic, distress signals).

3) Developed a React-based frontend with wake-word detection (e.g., "Hey Yuvi") to activate the assistant and stream user voice input to the backend.

4) Engineered a smart dialogue manager with DST, Hinglish support, and fallback RAG-based web summarization using Google Search API + Gemini.

5) Optimized model serving with CUDA memory tuning, CPU/GPU load balancing, and LRU caching for scalable and memory-efficient deployment.

6) Designed for extensibility with modular NLU pipelines, user profiling, and a consistent Delhi-style persona ("Yuvi") for in-car driver interactions.
